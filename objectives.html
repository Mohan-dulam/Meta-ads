<h2>Campaign Objectives & KPI Mapping</h2>

<p>The campaign objective instructs Meta algorithm what outcome to optimize for. Meta does not show ads to everyone — it predicts which users are most likely to complete the chosen action.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Awareness Objective</h3>
<p>Meta shows ads to users likely to remember the ad.</p>
<b>Use When:</b>
<ul>
<li>New brand</li>
<li>Store opening</li>
<li>Brand recognition campaigns</li>
</ul>
<b>KPI:</b> Reach, CPM, Ad recall lift

<hr>

<h3>Traffic Objective</h3>
<p>Optimizes for link clicks or landing page views.</p>
<b>KPI:</b> CPC, CTR, Landing page views

<hr>

<h3>Engagement Objective</h3>
<p>Optimizes for likes, comments, shares and post interactions.</p>
<b>KPI:</b> Engagement rate, Cost per engagement

<hr>

<h3>Lead Generation Objective</h3>
<p>Optimizes for form submissions.</p>
<b>KPI:</b> CPL (Cost per lead), Lead quality

<hr>

<h3>Sales Objective</h3>

<h3>Important Concept</h3>
<p>Meta learns from behavior patterns. If you select Traffic but expect leads, the algorithm will find clickers, not buyers.</p>
