<h2>Meta Ads Audience Strategy (Most Important Skill in Performance Marketing)</h2>

<p>In Meta advertising, targeting is not just selecting interests. It is about sending correct signals to Meta's machine learning algorithm. The algorithm performs best when we structure audiences based on funnel stage and intent level.</p>

<hr>

<h3>1. Core Audience (Cold Audience)</h3>

<p>Core audiences are users who never interacted with your business before. This stage focuses on discovery and awareness.</p>

<b>Available Targeting Signals:</b>
<ul>
<li>Location targeting (country, city, pin code, radius)</li>
<li>Age and gender segmentation</li>
<li>Languages</li>
<li>Interests (fitness, real estate, fashion, finance etc)</li>
<li>Behaviors (online shoppers, frequent travelers, device usage)</li>
<li>Demographics (education, job titles, relationship status)</li>
</ul>

<b>Best Practices:</b>
<ul>
<li>Do not over-narrow the audience</li>
<li>Avoid stacking 10+ interests</li>

<li>Let algorithm optimize</li>
</ul>

<b>Use Cases:</b>

<h3>2. Custom Audience (Warm Audience / Retargeting)</h3>

<p>Custom audiences contain people who already interacted with your brand. These audiences have higher conversion probability.</p>

<b>Types of Custom Audiences:</b>
<ul>
<li>Website visitors (via pixel)</li>
<li>Add to cart users</li>
<li>Instagram engagers</li>
<li>Facebook page engagers</li>
<li>Video viewers (25%, 50%, 75%, 95%)</li>
<li>Lead form openers</li>
<li>Customer database upload (emails/phone numbers)</li>
</ul>

<b>Retargeting Windows Strategy:</b>
<ul>
<li>0–3 days → Strong CTA ads</li>
<li>4–14 days → Benefits and testimonials</li>
<li>15–30 days → Offer or discount</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Lookalike Audience (Scaling Audience)</h3>

<p>Lookalike audience is created by Meta using machine learning to find users similar to converters.</p>

<b>Source Quality Ranking:</b>
<ul>
<li>Purchase audience (best)</li>
<li>Qualified leads</li>
<li>Add to cart users</li>
<li>Website visitors</li>
</ul>

<b>Percentage Meaning:</b>
<ul>
<li>1% = highest similarity, lowest reach</li>
<li>2–3% = balanced</li>
<li>5–10% = scaling</li>
</ul>
